### âš½Premier League Matches Prediction Modeling

---
## II. Project introduction

### ðŸ“ŒObjective
- Predicting wins with match information
    - Developing a model to predict the outcome of each match based on Premier League match data
        - Predicting the outcome of a match or score difference
        - Identify key variables that affect a match or team's performance
- Leverage for strategy
    - Create a betting strategy and analyze your returns
    - Enables strategy in Fantasy (Premier) League
    - Can be used in real-world match strategy

### ðŸ’¡Motivation
- Increase the commercial value of accurate match prediction
    - Maximize your betting returns
- Sports games like Fantasy League
    - The growing importance of using real-world game data to make decisions
- Contribute to the evolution of sports analytics by leveraging real-world game data
